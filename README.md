# Donkey Kong Arcade - Into The Dark

This is the Donkey Kong - Into The Dark rom-hack for the arcade version of Donkey Kong.

In this rom-hack Donkey Kong has decided to switch of the lights.
So you have to try to play the game in the dark, only the enemies like barrels, fireballs, springs and pies are visible.

To help you out, the light sometimes flashes briefly. This gives you a short glimpse of the surroundings that can help you find your way up.

The items are changed into a flash light, light bulb and a candle. As you might guess, picking these up will not only reward you with bonus points, but will also give you some short term visibility.

On most emulators (e.g. WolfMame) you can play this game by replacing the original dkong.zip by this Into The Dark version of the dkong.zip. You have to start the emulator without checksum checking (in WolfMame by starting it from the command line and specifying the romname).
